title: Training and Vizualizing Self Organizing Map(SOM) with Numerical Data
---
-> Recently i have started working in a cognitive science project. In our project, we wanted to use Self organising Map(SOM) for some cluster ->analysis purpose. While doing some research and implementation with SOM, i felt i could share my experience and learning with everyone and i can ->discuss step by step. I have implemented SOM with numerical dataset, the dataset is not so big either small. I will present and discuss the ->result a bit.
->Note: Data is not public , so not possible to share.  


Self organizing map is a great alternative for k means algorithm...
